            <p>Django handles most of the complexity of web development, allowing you to focus on developing your app rather than rebuilding the wheel. Django assists developers in avoiding many typical security mistakes by offering a framework that has been built to "do the right things" to automatically secure the website.</p>

            <p>Petty criminal acts, such as misrepresenting tolls on highways or skipping, speeding, vehicle burglary, and so on, are becoming more common in open traffic as the number of vehicles grows. As a result, recognizing vehicle tags is critical for safety. We were able to design an automatic vehicle monitoring system in the proposed design that may be implemented at the gates of the private parking entrance . The system was able to capture the vehicle's number plate as it was moving, providing a state-of-the-art real-time object detection using YOLOv3 [3]. Using convolutional neural networks and more hidden layers, we can detect and recognize considerably fast than traditional systems. In practically all recent major conditions, the accuracy for recognising the number plate from the vehicle was more than 90%. The system was able to detect the number plate for slanted plates with an inclination more than 60 in the video, but it requires more precision in eliminating unnecessary noises other than number plate pixels. With 25 epochs, the segmentation and recognition model reached an accuracy of 0.99, which is further boosted by further epochs and resulting in reduced loss.</p>
